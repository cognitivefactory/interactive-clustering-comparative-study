# Interactive Clustering : Annotation Error Study

The main goal of this study is to **estimate the time needed** for algorithms to reach their objectives.


## Hypotheses

This sub-repository provides an environment to carry out a comparative study of _Interactive Clustering_ implementation around one hypothese.
- **Hypothesis One**: `TODO`.


## Experimental protocol

`TODO`.


## Implementation

`TODO`.


## Installation and Execution

Follow the description of `README.md` repository file in order to setup your Python/R environment.

Then follow notebooks instructions.


## Results

Due to the volume of data generated (more than 25GB), not all results are versioned on GitHub.

However, a summary of results are stored in `results`.


## Scientific contribution
