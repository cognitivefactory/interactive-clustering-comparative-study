# Interactive Clustering : Computation Time Study

The main goal of this study is to **estimate the labeling error impact** on clustering results.


## Hypotheses

`TODO`.


## Experimental protocol

`TODO`.


## Implementation

`TODO`.


## Installation and Execution

Follow the description of `README.md` repository file in order to setup your Python/R environment.

Then follow notebooks instructions.


## Previous data

Some experiments needs data from previous studies.
Here, constraints annotations evolutions are expected from `1_convergence_study` study.
See the export notebook of this study and paste the exported files in the `previous` folder.


## Results

Due to the volume of data generated (more than 25GB), not all results are versioned on GitHub.

However, a summary of results are stored in `results`.


## Scientific contribution
