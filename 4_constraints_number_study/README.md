# Interactive Clustering : Constraints number Study

The main goal of this study is to **estimate the number of constraints needed** of the method one different dataset size.


## Hypotheses

This sub-repository provides an environment to carry out a comparative study of _Interactive Clustering_ implementation around one hypothese.
- **Hypothesis One**: `TODO`.

In fact, several implementations are available, and the main goal is to determine the best ones.


## Experimental protocol

`TODO`.


## Implementation

`TODO`.


## Installation and Execution

Follow the description of `README.md` repository file in order to setup your Python/R environment.

Then follow notebooks instructions.


## Results

Due to the volume of data generated (more than 25GB), not all results are versioned on GitHub.

However, a summary of results are stored in `results`.

In order to make a save in a `.tar.gz` file, you can use the following command:
```bash
tar -czf 4_constraints_number_study.tar.gz experiments/ notebook/ results/ README.md
```


## Scientific contribution

`TODO`.
