    "The several computations are :\n",
    "- `consistency_score`: Test a TF-IDF + Linear SVM model on its own trainset with a high prediction score threshold in order to check data consistency. The consistency score is the f1-score computed. If f1-score is low (i.e. less than `0.75`), then trainset can be inconsistent : Data may be badly labeled or classes may overlap. Otherwise, f1-score should tend to 100%.\n",
    "- `fmc_describtion`: Use the Features Maximization Contrast m√©thod of feature selection in order to describe a cluster by its relevant linguistic patterns.\n",
    "- `llm_summarization`: Use a large language model (`openai/GPT3.5`) to summarize each cluster as a one sentence description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some combinations of parameters are studied:\n",
    "- `simple_prep` + `tfidf` + `closest-50` + `hier_avg-10c`: best to reach 90% of v-measure (cf. efficiency study)\n",
    "- `lemma_prep` + `tfidf` + `closest-50` + `kmeans_COP-10c`: best to reach 100% of v-measure (cf. efficiency study)\n",
    "- `lemma_prep` + `tfidf` + `in_same-50` + `kmeans_COP-10c`: best to reach annotation completeness (cf. efficiency study)\n",
