# Interactive Clustering : 8. Inter-annotators Score Study

The main goal of this study is to **estimate the inter-annotators score** during constraints annotation.


## Hypotheses

This sub-repository provides an environment to carry out a comparative study of _Interactive Clustering_ implementation around one hypothese.
- **Robustness hypothesis**: _TODO._

In this study, we focus on annotation time.


## Experimental protocol

`TODO`.


## Implementation

`TODO`.


## Installation and Execution

Follow the description of `README.md` repository file in order to setup your Python/R environment.

Then follow notebooks instructions.


## Results

Due to the volume of data generated (around 35 GB), not all results are versioned on GitHub.

- results are zipped in a `.tar.gz` file and versioned on Zenodo : `TODO`.
- a summary of results are stored in `results`..

In order to make a save in a `.tar.gz` file, you can use the following command:
```bash
tar -czf 8_inter_annotators_score_study.tar.gz experiments/ notebook/ previous/ results/ README.md
```


## Scientific contribution

- One section of my PhD is dedicated to this study : `TODO`.
